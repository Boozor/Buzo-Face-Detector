# Buzo_Face_Detector

The app was developed using the Haar Cascade algorithm, OpenCV, Python 3.10, and Streamlit. The app utilizes a multi-stage process consisting of four key stages:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Haar Feature Selection
2Ô∏è‚É£ Creating Integral Images
3Ô∏è‚É£ Adaboost Training
4Ô∏è‚É£ Cascading Classifiers

This powerful combination of techniques enables the app to accurately detect faces in uploaded images. üì∏
By leveraging OpenCV and Python, I was able to implement the Haar Cascade algorithm effectively. Streamlit provided a user-friendly interface, allowing users to easily upload their images and obtain face detection results.
